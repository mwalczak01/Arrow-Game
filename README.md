# Dart Game
Built following along Youtube video entitled "How to make a Video Game | For Beginners | Unity 2022 | FULL TUTORIAL" by Jason Weimann (GameDev). Player clicks mouse, or taps screen, to shoot a spinning object to achieve the highest score without hitting attached arrows.

# What I Learned
1. Player Mechanic - Input.GetButtonDown
2. Creating prefabs
3. Delay spawning of objects without resetting game

# My Contributions
1. Debugging score to not increase upon striking another arrow
2. Added bow and arrow images
