# Arrow-Game
I made an arrow shooting game on Unity utilizing C# scripts. Player clicks mouse, or taps screen, to shoot a spinning object to achieve the highest score without hitting attached arrows.

# What I Learned
1. Player Mechanic - Input.GetButtonDown
2. Creating prefabs
3. Delay spawning of objects without resetting game
4. Debugging score to not increase upon striking another arrow
